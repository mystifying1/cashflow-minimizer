In financial transactions involving multiple individuals or entities, settling debts 
efficiently with minimal transactions is crucial. The Cash Flow Minimizer aims to 
optimize payments among a group of people to reduce the total number of 
transactions required for debt settlement. This system utilizes a priority queue 
implemented using a linked list to efficiently manage and process outstanding 
balances. 
The approach involves computing the net balance of each individual by summing 
their credits and debits. These net balances are then stored in a priority queue, 
where the most indebted (minimum) and most credited (maximum) individuals are 
identified. The algorithm iteratively matches debtors to creditors, settling debts in 
the least number of transactions while maintaining transaction integrity. 
This implementation ensures efficient cash flow management, reducing financial 
complexity and optimizing payments. The menu-driven approach allows users to 
input transactions, view balances, and compute optimal settlements dynamically. 
The use of a priority queue in a linked list ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and 
retrieval of transactions, making the algorithm highly scalable and effective for 
real-world applications.
